// Package stdout provides stdout-based exporting capabilities for the tracing package.
// This package is intended to enable trace data to be output to the console for
// development and debugging purposes.
//
// Note: This is currently a placeholder package. For production tracing functionality,
// use the otlp package which provides export to OpenTelemetry-compatible collectors.
package stdout

// This package is a placeholder for future implementation of a console/stdout
// trace exporter, which would be useful for local development and debugging
// without requiring an external collector.
